# Nirav Sheth's Blog
Written in C# with ASP.NET

I wanted to created this website to showcase my knowledge of C# and ASP.NET since I do not have work experience in this language. In addition, I wanted to create this website to keep me sane during time and allow me to keep myself accountable for learning or trying something new. Everyday, I will post an update about what I've learned, accomplished, or updates in my unemployment journey. 

If you're interested in hiring me, please feel free to contact me using any of the methods available below.
