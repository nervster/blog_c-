                            <p>(DEV IN PROGRESS) The idea stemmed from a bottom-up approach to savings. Other budget apps require you to create a monthly budget and money dwindles down until the end of the month, but it's been hard to use those apps because it's hard to know how much to pace ourselves per day. This app uses a bottom up approach to set a daily allowance and rolls over any savings to the next day. At the end of the month, you can either start over or roll over a certain amount to the next. A prototype that I build with Retool has allowed me and my friends to actually start saving!</p>

                            <p>Daycare and baby sitting costs are getting out of control!! Why let some random person take care of your kids when you can share the responsiblity with your friends, family and friendly neighbors. After all, it takes a village to raise a kid so why don't we bring that concept to day care? This Android Mobile App was build to help tackle that problem in coordination with a team from CodePath bootcamp.</p>

                            <p>When I got my younger cat, Floofy, he liked to eat my older cats food. The original idea was that I would use a Image Learning Model to train on my cats and then use that to build a device to scare off the cat. However, I found an easier solution for my problem. Nonetheless, it was a fun project setting this up on a Raspberry Pi and getting to detect my cats.</p>
